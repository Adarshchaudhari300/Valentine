🎉 QUICK SETUP FOR FALLING PHOTOS 🎉

Step 1: Create the photos folder (if it doesn't exist)
   → The folder is already at: D:\Valentine\public\photos\

Step 2: Save the 30 images from your message
   → Download/save all the photos you shared
   → You have about 30 couple photos

Step 3: Rename them sequentially
   photo1.jpg  - First photo (the one at the bowling alley)
   photo2.jpg  - Second photo (the green background one)
   photo3.jpg  - Metro photo
   photo4.jpg  - Puja POV one
   photo5.jpg  - Friday timestamp
   ... continue ...
   photo30.jpg - Last photo

Step 4: Copy to folder
   → Copy ALL renamed photos to: D:\Valentine\public\photos\

Step 5: Rebuild
   npm run build

Step 6: Test locally (optional)
   npm run dev
   → Visit http://localhost:5173
   → You should see photos falling in background!

Step 7: Deploy to Netlify
   → Drag the updated 'dist' folder to Netlify

✨ RESULT:
Your beautiful memories will fall gracefully across the screen like a waterfall on every page, creating a stunning backdrop of your journey together!

The photos will:
- Rotate as they fall
- Fade in and out
- Appear continuously
- Be bordered like Polaroids
- Cover all 6 Valentine days!

💡 TIP: Use your best photos - they'll be visible at 120x120px size!
